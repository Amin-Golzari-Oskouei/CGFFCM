# CGFFCM-Cluster-weight-and-Group-local-Feature-weight-learning-in-Fuzzy-C-Means-clustering-algorithm

The Source_Code file includes the MATLAB implementation of the CGFFCM algorithm as described in:

A.Golzari oskouei, M.Hashemzadeh, B.Asheghi, and M.Balafar, "CGFFCM: Cluster-weight and Group-local Feature-weight learning in Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm for color image segmentation", Applied Soft Computing, 2021 (submitted).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm to better understand the code. Also, a demo file is implemented for ease of running of the algorithm, which is running by importing data and other necessary algorithm parameters.

To evaluate the proposed algorithmâ€™s performance, we use the benchmark Berkeley dataset. There are some images of this dataset in the uploaded file (Test_Dataset.rar). Whole dataset is available on: https://github.com/BIDS/BSDS500.git.
