# CGFFCM-Cluster-weight-and-Group-local-Feature-weight-learning-in-Fuzzy-C-Means-clustering-algorithm

The Source_Code file includes the MATLAB implementation of the CGFFCM algorithm as described in:

A.Golzari oskouei, M.Hashemzadeh, B.Asheghi, and M.Balafar, "CGFFCM: Cluster-weight and Group-local Feature-weight learning in Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm for color image segmentation", Applied Soft Computing, 2021 (submitted).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm to better understand the code. Also, a demo is implemented for ease of running, which is running by importing data and other necessary algorithm parameters.

To evaluate the proposed algorithm’s performance, we use the benchmark Berkeley dataset. There are some images of this dataset in the uploaded file (Test_Dataset.rar). Whole dataset is available on: https://github.com/BIDS/BSDS500.git.
