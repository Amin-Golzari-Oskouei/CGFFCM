The uploaded file includes the MATLAB implementation of CGFFCM algorithm as described in:

A.Golzari oskouei, M.Hashemzadeh, B.Asheghi and M.Balafar, "CGFFCM: Cluster-weight and Group-local Feature-weight learning in Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm for color image segmentation", Applied Soft Computing, 2021 (submited).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm to better understand the code. In addition, a demo file is implemented for ease of running of the algorithm, which is running by importing data and other necessary algorithm parameters.

To evaluate the proposed algorithmâ€™s performance, we use the benchmark Berkeley dataset.There are some images of this dataset in the uploaded file. whole dataset is available on: https://github.com/BIDS/BSDS500.git.
